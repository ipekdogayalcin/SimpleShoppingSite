# Doğa's Shopping Site

This is a Django-based clothing themed shopping site where users can:
-register to create new customers
-log in if they already have an account 
-add products to their shop
-add products to their cart (multiple of the same product can also be added, stated as quantity)
-edit and update product features
-make purchases (if there is enough stock of all products in cart, otherwise purchase fails)
-view their purchase history

## How Does It Work?

You may use the following account I have prepared with products:
username: dogayalcin
password: 2222

Or create a brand new empty account :) 

SHOP PAGE
To add a product to their shop, users have to fill in the forms and copy paste their image url.
Once the products are added, they can add as many of the products as they like to their cart.
To add more of the same product, simply click the add to cart button again.

MY CART PAGE
Once cart is ready to go, fill in the forms with your card credentials, address, cvc, expiry date.
If there is enough stock, the purchase will go through and log to the purchases page.

PURCHASES PAGE
Stores the purchase details. You may go back and view your previous purchases whenever you want.
Stock value of each product will decrease according to the number of times purchased.

PRODUCT DETAILS PAGE
You may check the stock values by clicking on the Product Details button under the logged products in shop.
There you can change the stock as well as the other attributes of the products.
Once you click update, it will save the new values you entered.
